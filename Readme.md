✈️ Flight Price Prediction (EDA & Feature Engineering)

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes flight ticket data to understand the factors affecting flight prices. The notebook focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering, preparing the dataset for machine learning models.

👉 Note: Model training is not included yet. The processed dataset is ready for regression model building in the next phase.

🗂️ Dataset
Source: flight_price.xlsx

✅ The final dataframe contains only numeric values and is ready for model training.

📊 Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn: OneHotEncoder
Jupyter Notebook for development


📈 Next Steps
Train machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
Deploy model as a web app with Flask or Streamlit.
